What have we done till now?
- Have setup two data generation approaches
- Have created a trainer for the full model
- Have created a trainer for the NTK version of the model
- Tried creating but failed, to create a trainer for the piped NTK version of the model ---> Needs attention
- Tried plotting the performance (loss and accuracy) of the full, NTK and hybrid versions of the models
